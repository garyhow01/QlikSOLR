# QlikSOLR

Example of integrating Qlik Sense with Apache SOLR on top of a Cloudera cluster.

The code is based on my QlikSocial demo, found here: https://github.com/johsund/QlikSocial
Configuration steps for certificates and getting tickets is the same. Currently the paths for Apache SOLR are hard coded so it's not completely trivial to take the code and repurpose for another site.

Do reach out to me if you have any questions.
